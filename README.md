I use this to start basic Express API apps

You can figure it out. It's almost certainly bloated with stuff I don't really *need* but what I really need is to never have to think about messing with this again when I just want to start things up.

I'll deal with optimizing and cleaning up if ever I deploy something I don't want to think about it right when I have an idea for something.
